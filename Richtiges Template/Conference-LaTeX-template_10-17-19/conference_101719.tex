\newline
\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Web Frameworks}

Frameworks already contain numerous functions in software development as proposed solutions for individual problems faced by various developers. This way, they do not have to start from scratch whenever they want to write new software. A framework is a program skeleton that serves as a foundation for software development.

When a framework serves as the foundation for web applications, it is referred to as a web application framework. A framework describes a collection of interacting classes and thus also fixes the design structure for software developed based on the framework~\cite{ionos_webframeworks}.
\newline\subsubsection{Pros and Cons of Web Application Frameworks}
Web frameworks offer many advantages, but they also come with some disadvantages.
\newline\subsubsection{Advantages}
\textit{Reduced Development Time and Cost:} By using templates for basic functions such as database connections, caching, and security, development time is significantly reduced.
\newline\textit{Open Source:} Most web frameworks are available as open-source, eliminating licensing costs.
\newline\textit{Clean and Maintainable Code:} Frameworks promote the creation of clean and maintainable code, as developers can rely on proven building blocks.
\newline\newline\newline\textit{Community Support:} Regular improvements and quick fixes for security vulnerabilities are provided by the community~\cite{ionos_webframeworks}.
\newline
\subsubsection{Disadvantages}

\textit{Framework-Specific Requirements:} Different frameworks have different design principles, potentially requiring compromises based on the project.
\newline\textit{Code Bloat:} Developers may not use all available functions, leading to unnecessary code.
\newline\textit{Dependency Risks:} Reliance on a framework and its provider can be risky if the framework is discontinued or its development slows.
\newline\textit{Learning Curve:} Familiarizing oneself with a framework’s structure and use takes time.
\newline\textit{Security Risks:} Publicly accessible source code can pose security risks for enterprise applications~\cite{ionos_webframeworks}.
\newline
\subsection{Introduction to JavaScript Web Application Frameworks and Dynamic Web Content}

JavaScript is a versatile programming language particularly suited for work in web browsers. Originally developed by Netscape, it has become one of the most widely used programming languages on the web, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive content by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). Direct manipulation of the DOM can be challenging, which is where JavaScript frameworks and libraries come into play. They provide tools to simplify these and other aspects of programming, making JavaScript frameworks especially suitable for developing complex web applications. These frameworks offer a structured approach and pre-built components, enabling more efficient development once the concepts and guidelines of a particular framework are mastered~\cite{ionos_jsframeworks}.
\newline
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM is crucial for creating dynamic web content, which is essential for modern web applications that need to be interactive and responsive~\cite{mdn_dom}. Leveraging JavaScript frameworks and libraries facilitates the manipulation of the DOM, streamlining the creation of dynamic web content.
\newline
\subsubsection{Benefits of Dynamic Web Content}

Personalization tailors content based on user preferences, demographics, or behavior, which can significantly boost engagement and conversion rates.
