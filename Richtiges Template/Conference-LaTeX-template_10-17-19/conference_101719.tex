Besides the structure, the motivation section also covers the challenges and goals of this study. The following three chapters include the theoretical background, which discusses web frameworks and compares Vue and Angular, a case study detailing a practical application and its analysis, and concludes with recommendations and future outlook.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Web Frameworks}

Frameworks already contain numerous functions in software development as proposed solutions for individual problems faced by various developers. This way, they do not have to start from scratch whenever they want to write new software. A framework is a program skeleton that serves as a foundation for software development.

When a framework serves as the foundation for web applications, it is referred to as a web application framework. A framework describes a collection of interacting classes and thus also fixes the design structure for software developed based on the framework~\cite{ionos_webframeworks}.
\newline\subsubsection{Pros and Cons of Web Application Frameworks}
Web frameworks offer many advantages, but they also come with some disadvantages.
\subsubsection{Advantages}
\textit{Reduced Development Time and Cost:} By using templates for basic functions such as database connections, caching, and security, development time is significantly reduced.
\newline\textit{Open Source:} Most web frameworks are available as open-source, eliminating licensing costs.
\newline\textit{Clean and Maintainable Code:} Frameworks promote the creation of clean and maintainable code, as developers can rely on proven building blocks.
\newline\textit{Community Support:} Regular improvements and quick fixes for security vulnerabilities are provided by the community~\cite{ionos_webframeworks}.

\subsubsection{Disadvantages}

\textit{Framework-Specific Requirements:} Different frameworks have different design principles, potentially requiring compromises based on the project.
\newline\textit{Code Bloat:} Developers may not use all available functions, leading to unnecessary code.
\newline\textit{Dependency Risks:} Reliance on a framework and its provider can be risky if the framework is discontinued or its development slows.
\newline\textit{Learning Curve:} Familiarizing oneself with a framework’s structure and use takes time.
\newline\textit{Security Risks:} Publicly accessible source code can pose security risks for enterprise applications~\cite{ionos_webframeworks}.

\subsection{Introduction to JavaScript Web Application Frameworks and Dynamic Web Content}

JavaScript is a versatile programming language particularly suited for work in web browsers. Originally developed by Netscape, it has become one of the most widely used programming languages on the web, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive content by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). Direct manipulation of the DOM can be challenging, which is where JavaScript frameworks and libraries come into play. They provide tools to simplify these and other aspects of programming, making JavaScript frameworks especially suitable for developing complex web applications. These frameworks offer a structured approach and pre-built components, enabling more efficient development once the concepts and guidelines of a particular framework are mastered~\cite{ionos_jsframeworks}.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM is crucial for creating dynamic web content, which is essential for modern web applications that need to be interactive and responsive~\cite{mdn_dom}. Leveraging JavaScript frameworks and libraries facilitates the manipulation of the DOM, streamlining the creation of dynamic web content.

\subsubsection{Benefits of Dynamic Web Content}

Personalization tailors content based on user preferences, demographics, or behavior, which can significantly boost engagement and conversion rates. Personalized experiences are crucial for retaining visitors and improving user satisfaction. Real-time updates provide timely information without refreshing the entire page, which is essential for news websites, social media platforms, and e-commerce sites. JavaScript enables real-time updates through asynchronous requests and data manipulation. Enhanced user engagement through interactive features such as live chat, dynamic forms, and multimedia sliders captivates users, extending session duration and reducing bounce rates.

\subsubsection{Implementing Dynamic Web Content}

To effectively implement dynamic web content using JavaScript and jQuery, it is important to clearly define goals, whether to enhance user experience, increase conversions, or improve engagement metrics. Utilizing user data by analyzing behavior with tools like Google Analytics helps in personalizing content and tailoring dynamic elements based on preferences and interactions. Choosing appropriate technologies, such as JavaScript frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Vue.js) and jQuery plugins, streamlines development and ensures cross-browser compatibility. Continuously testing dynamic features, gathering user feedback, and refining implementations optimize performance and user satisfaction.

jQuery is a lightweight, fast, and feature-rich JavaScript library renowned for simplifying HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions. It provides an intuitive API that seamlessly operates across various browsers. With its versatility and extendibility, jQuery has revolutionized JavaScript development for millions of users worldwide~\cite{jquery_history}.

By leveraging JavaScript and jQuery for dynamic web content, websites can offer personalized, engaging experiences that cater to modern user expectations~\cite{moldstud2024}.

\subsection{JavaScript for Complex Web Applications}

JavaScript is well-suited for complex web applications due to its versatility and the powerful features of modern JavaScript frameworks. These frameworks provide a structured environment for development, making it easier to manage large codebases and maintain code quality.

\subsubsection{Alternatives to JavaScript}

\textit{TypeScript:} A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, making it easier to catch errors early.
\newline\textit{Dart:} Developed by Google, Dart is used in conjunction with the Flutter framework for building web and mobile apps.
\newline\textit{Elm:} A functional language that compiles to JavaScript, focused on simplicity and quality tooling~\cite{mdn-js-guide}

\subsection {Comparison Criteria}

When evaluating web development frameworks, metrics play a crucial role as they enable an objective analysis of performance and efficiency. By comparing load times, responsiveness, and resource utilization, frameworks like Angular and Vue can be assessed in various scenarios to determine their performance.

\subsubsection{Performance}
Performance metrics are measured using the developer console, focusing on loading times and responsiveness. Loading times are assessed by recording the time taken from the start of the page load until the application is fully interactive. Responsiveness is evaluated by measuring the time taken for the application to react to user inputs and interactions after the initial load, ensuring minimal delay and smooth performance.
\subsubsection{Developer-friendliness}
Angular provides a structured environment with an array of features, complemented by detailed documentation and a well-established community, as outlined in the official Angular documentation. In contrast, Vue is noted for its straightforward integration and clear syntax, which enhances ease of use and adaptability in various project sizes, according to the official Vue.js documentation~\cite{angular, vue}.

\subsubsection{Community Support}
Community support is essential for the ongoing development and troubleshooting of software frameworks. This is underscored by a study conducted by Jelica Cincović and Marija Punt, which analyzed community engagement through GitHub repository statistics. According to their findings, presented in the graph below, React commands the largest community support, with Angular and Vue also showing significant but smaller communities~\cite{cincovic2020comparison}.
